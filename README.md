# Online Slip Detection and Friction Coefficient Estimation

Purpose
This repo contains a ROS2 node that detects slip (drift) events and estimates a representative friction coefficient (mu) from IMU + odometry data for experiments used in the associated paper.

Key file
- src/drift_detector/drift_detector/revised_detector.py — ROS2 Node that:
  - Subscribes to: /ackermann_cmd (AckermannDriveStamped), /odom (Odometry), /sensors/imu/raw (Imu), /odometry/filtered (Odometry)
  - Publishes: Bool on topic `is_drifting`
  - Computes a slip metric from the difference between filtered and raw odometry magnitudes
  - During detected drift windows computes mu = sqrt(ax^2 + ay^2) / az using IMU linear acceleration
  - Buffers per-event mu values and prints/stores per-run summaries

How detection works (concise)
- If slip_estimate > linear_threshold for longer than drift_length, node enters drifting window
- While drifting, mu samples are appended: mu = sqrt(ax^2 + ay^2) / az
- On drift end the node records the maximum mu from the event (used by downstream analysis)

Runtime outputs (useful for parsing)
- The node prints arrays at shutdown:
  - Times: list of drift start timestamps (REMOVE_DRIFT_TIMES)
  - Mus: list of recorded mu values per event (REMOVE_DRIFT_MUS)
These prints are intended for downstream parsing and k-fold analysis.

Dataset
- An Excel file with all collected runs is included in the repo (place under `Data/Mu&OffsetData.xlsx` or update the README path to your workbook location).
